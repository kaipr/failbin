== failbin - exception catcher for ruby-on-rails projects
Failbin was made to catch exception emails generated by the exception_notification-plugin and display them aggregated by project and exception type on a webinterface. It's multi-project and multi-user capable and has per-user notification features.

WARNING:
Failbin is in development state. It was developped in about a week to run and needs a lot of polishing, testing and some refactoring. Keep an eye on this repository for further development. I would like to see people forking it and help me on the path to a production-ready state.

== Install
* You need an IMAP email account for the exception_notification emails (googlemail works fine)
* Install needed gems via: "rake gems:install" (test environment needs some more: "rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test")
* Create the database.yml and mail_fetcher.yml files with your configurations (see example files)
* Load the schema: "rake db:schema:load"
* Run tests and make sure everything is fine: "rake test" (I know, there should and will be more tests)

== Usage
* Start server, register and login
* Create a project and have a look at the example shown on the edit page to modify your exception_notification-plugin
* Fetch exception emails (should run periodically): rake fetcher:fetch_mails

For security reasons you should change some strings:
* REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY in config/initializiers/site_keys.rb (warning: breaks some User and Session tests because of fixtures, subject to change)
* key and secret in config/initializers/session_store.rb
* SECRET_STRING in config/environment.rb (used for generating project keys)


I know this is a short readme and by far don't covers the whole thing, which will hopefully change in near future. For more follow @failbin on twitter.
